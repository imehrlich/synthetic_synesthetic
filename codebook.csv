danceability,"Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable."
acousticness,A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of how acoustic the track is.
energy,"Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy."
instrumentalness,"Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content."
liveness,"Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. According to the official documentation, “a value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.”"
loudness,The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track. Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.
speechiness,"Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value."
tempo,"The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration."
valence,"A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."
key,"The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = Csharp/Dflat, 2 = D, and so on."
mode,"Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0."
